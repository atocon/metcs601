            <p>
                My name is Alec O'Connor and I am originally from Hudson, New Hampshire. 
                I attended college at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania 
                State University</a> (Penn State) where I earned a Bachelor of Science in 
                Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my time at Penn State, I 
                participated in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) 
                Program where I earned a commission as an active duty U.S. Air Force 
                Officer. Following graduation, I received my first Air Force assignment 
                and was lucky enough to get stationed close to home at Hanscom Air Force 
                Base in Bedford, Massachusetts. I have worked at Hanscom for three years 
                as a developmental engineer working on both airfield weather and air 
                traffic systems.
                <br><br>
                During the early years of my career, I worked with a lot of computer hardware 
                and software. I quickly realized that I wanted to work with computer 
                hardware and software, so I applied to the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">
                Boston University</a> (BU) Master of Science in Software Development 
                (MSSD) Program and was accepted! I am about halfway through the MSSD 
                Program; I have completed courses focused on Python coding, Java coding, 
                software design patterns, software algorithms, and information systems. 
                When I am not working or studying, I like to indulge in my favorite 
                hobbies which include cooking, watching movies, and playing computer games.

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p>
                I have always enjoyed good food. As I was growing up, my family was 
                always cooking homemade meals for weeknight dinners and family events. 
                I learned basic cooking techniques from my mother and grandmother, and 
                began experimenting with many different recipes over the past eight years. 
                Here is one of my favorite recipes, which I recently tried:

                    Stir together saffron and 1/4 cup of the chicken broth in a

                    Heat olive oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high 
                    heat. Add chorizo and cook until browned. Remove chorizo and 
                    transfer to a plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add chicken, black pepper, and 1 tsp of sea salt to the skillet. 
                    Cook chicken over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Remove 
                    chicken and transfer to the plate with chorizo.

                <li>
                    Add onion and bell pepper to the skillet and cook over

                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in garlic and paprika and cook until fragrant. Stir in 
                    diced tomatoes and rice, and cook until the liquid is almost

                <li>
                    Stir in the saffron mixture and remaining 3 cups of chicken

                    Return chorizo and chicken to the skillet and stir lightly to 
                    cover partially with rice. Cook, uncovered and undisturbed, 
                    over low-medium heat for about 20 minutes.

                I also like to play computer games on the computer I built when I have 
                spare time. I enjoy computer games because they offer a way to be social 
                with long-distance friends and have some fun. These are some of the 
                games I have been actively playing:
