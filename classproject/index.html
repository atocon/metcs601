            <p>
                My name is Alec O'Connor and I am originally from Hudson, New Hampshire. 
                I attended college at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania 
                State University</a> (Penn State) where I earned a Bachelor of Science in 
                Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my time at Penn State, I 
                participated in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) 
                Program where I earned a commission as an active duty U.S. Air Force 
                Officer. Following graduation, I received my first Air Force assignment 
                and was lucky enough to get stationed close to home at Hanscom Air Force 
                Base in Bedford, Massachusetts. I have worked at Hanscom for three years 
                as a developmental engineer working on both airfield weather and air 
                traffic systems.
                <br> <br>
                During the early years of my career, I worked with a lot of computer hardware 
                and software. I quickly realized that I wanted to work with computer 
                hardware and software, so I applied to the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">
                Boston University</a> (BU) Master of Science in Software Development 
                (MSSD) Program and was accepted! I am about halfway through the MSSD 
                Program; I have completed courses focused on Python coding, Java coding, 
                software design patterns, software algorithms, and information systems. 
                When I am not working or studying, I like to indulge in my favorite 
                hobbies which include cooking, watching movies, and playing computer games.
