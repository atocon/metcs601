        <p>My name is Alec and I am originally from Hudson, New Hampshire. I attended college at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my time at Penn State, I participated in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Program where I earned a commission as an active duty U.S. Air Force Officer. Following graduation, I received my first Air Force assignment and was lucky enough to get stationed close to home at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Massachusetts. I have worked at Hanscom for three years as a developmental engineer working on both airfield weather and air traffic systems.</p>
        <p>During the early years of my career, I worked with a lot of computer hardware and software. I quickly realized that I wanted to work with computer hardware and software, so I applied to the Boston University (BU) Master of Science in Software Development (MSSD) Program and was accepted! I am about halfway through the MSSD Program; I have completed courses focused on Python coding, Java coding, software design patterns, software algorithms, and information systems. When I am not working or studying, I like to indulge in my favorite hobbies which include cooking, watching movies, and playing computer games.</p>
