        <p>My name is Alec O'Connor and I am originally from Hudson, New Hampshire. 
		I attended college at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania 
		State University</a> (Penn State) where I earned a Bachelor of Science in 
		Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my time at Penn State, I 
		participated in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) 
		Program where I earned a commission as an active duty U.S. Air Force 
		Officer. Following graduation, I received my first Air Force assignment 
		and was lucky enough to get stationed close to home at Hanscom Air Force 
		Base in Bedford, Massachusetts. I have worked at Hanscom for three years 
		as a developmental engineer working on both airfield weather and air 
		traffic systems.
	</p>
        <p>During the early years of my career, I worked with a lot of computer hardware 
		and software. I quickly realized that I wanted to work with computer 
		hardware and software, so I applied to the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">
		Boston University</a> (BU) Master of Science in Software Development 
		(MSSD) Program and was accepted! I am about halfway through the MSSD 
		Program; I have completed courses focused on Python coding, Java coding, 
		software design patterns, software algorithms, and information systems. 
		When I am not working or studying, I like to indulge in my favorite 
		hobbies which include cooking, watching movies, and playing computer games.
